    <div id="about" class="center">
        <p>Hello! My name is Nathan Russo, and I am thrilled you are checking out my game.<br /></p>
        <p>
            &emsp;I have always enjoyed making mazes. I would draw massive ones in the sand at the beach.
            During my 1st year, I participated in <a href="https://hacks.csh.rit.edu/">CSH Hacks</a>.
            During that event, I decided to generate version 0 of Dev-Maze. It was written in Python,
            using Turtle. It generated one maze and allowed the player (turtle) to move from the start
            corner to the end corner.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;As a member of <a href="https://csh.rit.edu/">CSH</a>, I must create a major project once a
            year. Using the idea from CSH Hacks, I decided to make Dev-Maze proper on CSH's arcade machine
            <a href="https://devcade.csh.rit.edu/">Devcade</a>. Dev-Maze was written in C# and MonoGame.
            The game generates random, loop-erased mazes, using a variation of Wilson's Maze Algorithm.
            The player can select 9 different maze sizes from a 1x2 to a 40x80.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;After completing Dev-Maze for my 1st year project, I had one reoccurring issue. Non-CSH members
            could not access my game. So, for my 2nd year project, I decided to recreate Dev-Maze through a
            website to allow anyone to play the game. Unlike before, Dev-Maze Website is written in HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for reading the history of Dev-Maze and I hope you enjoy.</p>
