# Dev-Maze-Website
Dev-Maze is a video game that generates mazes for the player to solve. 
This website is an improved recreation of my original Dev-Maze game made on CSH's Devcade game. 
To learn more about the original Dev-Maze, checks out my Devcade-Game repository. 
Dev-Maze uses a variation of Wilsonâ€™s Maze Algorithm to create random, loop-erased mazes for the player to solve. The complexity of the mazes depends on the limits of the website's window. 
It can generate any sized maze from a 1x1 to the max number of rows x the max of columns.
As the screen gets larger, the mazes can become more complex. 
If the mazes are less complex, the website will increase the block size to maximize the available space.
